# Hello Everyone!

## Write below, just don't delete what someone else said, just on top so the newest said comment is at the top. Use the "####" before your comment and whitespace under, then your signature. Also feel free to change your name and/or "Tag Name" in the credits and dev pool files. (<i>...<b>/credits.yaml</b></i> && <i>...<b>/api/devpool.js</b></i>) 

#### So, we will be using Github for the interactions, why not a general way to chat about topics or specifics afterwards that can be removed later. Keep in mind, everything will be findable through  the system later on and evetually this git will go live, either when we get our Tron launch or if becomes stale. Don't worry, I feel like we'll get this! We have a great team, that's all of us in the .../credits.yanl and with a great team and communitications, success can be achived. Welcome everyone, glad to have you!
