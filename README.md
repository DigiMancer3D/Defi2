# Defi2
Changing the way defi works with cryptocurrency.
</br></br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Defi tries to encourage quick investing entry in a gamified way where the sooner one gets in, the more tokens/value that may be received in as interest or rebasing the circulating supply of the current token. So this increases the circulating supply without additional tokens being minted/purchased. The gamified entry method tends to cause a spike in value for the token, rebasing after the tokens are minted can help reduce the value of the token. This is a common tactic in stable coins so seeing this with non-stable coins is intended to help the next wave of investors or consumers of the token.</br></br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Defi 2.0 takes this gamified entry with rebasing model and reverses what tokens gets locked, has the participants pre-pay for the rebasing tokens that get minted but the returns are given back 4% of rebase pool per new pool season. A pool season is the entry periods where investors/consumers will be able to pre-purchase tokens and the rebase. Once the pool season is over, the tokens will not be able to be purchased through the contract until the next pool season begins. Pool seasons have a short <i>cool-down</i> period equal to half the time of each pool season.</br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because investors/consumers are paying 25% of the pool size, the tokens become more expensive in retrospect since the cost for a participants total tokens purchase increases after every participant entry.</br></br><b>New tactics are being used in Defi 2.0 tokens which are as follows:</b></br><ol>- Instead of participants locking the tokens received from initial minting, the rebase tokens are locked until rebase distribution at the start of every new pool season loop</ol><ol>- Entry and minting is done in predetermined seasons based on time measures since the last season end</ol><ol>- Each pool season controls their own wallets and so if one is hacked, only that pool season wallet is effected</ol><ol>- Prepay ReBase Minting</ol><ol>- Minting ReBase at inital Minting</ol><ol>- Taking 25 new Pool Seasons to distribute all of a ReBase pool from per pool season</ol><ol>- Limited Burn-&-Mix burn method for participants swapping without exchanges</ol><ol>- New Gamified methods seen are as follows:</br><ol>- ReBase Price Inflation per Entry</ol><ol>- Multiple Address per entity for multiple entries per entity</ol><ol>- Burning token amount is based on participant entry pool size</ol><ol>- Layered Return possibility</ol><ol>- All participants are able to receive Ultra pool rewards</ol></ol>

## How is this feasible?
Demand based inflation, Automated reduced circulation of Tokens, Burn-&-Mix
</br></br>The design in the new defi token economics are:</br><ol>- User usability from not locking user held defi tokens</ol><ol>- Applying real world community assistance financial pools model</ol><ol>- Injecting temparory inflation based on demand</ol><ol>- Mixing returned to-be-burned tokens instead of burning</ol><ol>- Controlled circulation by frozen rebase pools</ol><ol>- Seperating pool seasons for season independance</ol></br></br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without this new design Defi tokens would stay a fools IPO game. These new actions cause legitimacy by the contract instead having hopes the devs won't exit scam. If a dev builds the contract correctly, they will be paid out per season end, enforcing developers to want to see longevity in the project. Since rebase is acitivated by new pool seasons, participants are enforced to want to see longevity in the project. Because extra native tokens are distributed to all participants when the ultra pool (or overflow wallet) reaches a specific amount, this enforces participants to want to have higher amounts in each intial pool minting so they can mark more tokens to be burned to increase the speed the ultra pool fills up & enfroces longevity. Because Defi 2.0 tokens' smart contracts can distribute the Defi tokens as well as the native tokens, all participants (even if only once) has a chance to recieve a portion of their entry back as a longevity reward (Ultra Pool distribution).</br></br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Defi 2.0 Tokens are all about gamifing as much aspects possible in Defi token economics to help increase the longevity. Defi 2.0 is a system where all participants win, even if they don't break even. <sup>**<sub>Defi 2.0 tokens do not guarantee profit.</sub>**</sup>

## What's Actually Happening?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Defi 2.0 is gmaified investing wtih prepaid interest pools. So let's break it down:</br>
- Participants are incentivized to enter sooner during pool seasons for the more native tokens dropped into the minting pool means the more new participants have to pay 25% of.
- Participants are prepaying the rebase pool via the incentive entry setup (the 25% extra of minting pool paid per entry).
- - Minium entry threshold will be different per chain but should be approximately 75% of minimum minting cost + the minimum minting cost.
- - In Example: if the tron minimum is 1024 $TRX to mint tokens, the minimum for each entry must be at least 1350 $TRX to ensure even with one entry, minting can be performed.
- Participants are paying the minting cost + rebase additional percentage + Dev Pool (10% of total entry) + Burn Pool (15% of total entry).
- - Because the Dev pool and Burn pool comes out of the minting funds before the minting occurs, it is paid by the rebase incentive system. If the number of entries are low or the amount of native coins in the minting pool are low, the dev pool and burn pool will lower the minting power which is fine as long as it doesn't happen too often in a row. If this happens too often, the token price being minted will go down but since the entry incentive can cause price spikes, this is just offsetting each other.
- 75% of the participant's entries (the minting pool) is used to mint tokens, becuase of the entry incentive there should be more minted then planned.
- - Planned Minting is based on 75% of each entry, regardless of that entry's rebase pay amount (which is only known to the participant).
- 25% of the minted defi2 tokens are locked until end of next pool season (approx locked for 4.5 days per release).
- - the rebase Pool (the 25% of minted locked tokens) is locked in a series of 4% of pool at the time of locking as seperate ammounts. By having a timed-release mechanism where a predefined amount of tokens is released to the participant's entry pool (the minitng pool address) but only addresses from the time of the start of that pool season to the end of that pool season (a pool season is approx 3 days [72hrs] with a 1.5 days [36hrs] cool down), then after the same amount of time later (approx 4.5 days [108hrs]) it happens again and again until all 25 releases of the minted locked coins are distributed.
- Participants are paying not based on the defi token's price but the cost factor to mint, rebase and extras so after a handful of seasons the cost to buy during a pool season should be cheaper then exchanging. This will incentice people to burn tokens at the price of the token for native tokens (which are relased during/before minting and can only equal 15% of the minting pool at any time during an open pool season. This gamifies the burning process as well and allowing previous participants to re-participate in later pool seasons. Theroetically a participant could participate in every pool season except the 2cd season if they only burned defi tokens recieved to re-paricipate in later seasons.
- - Initial release is based on the amount the wallet address entered but only 75% of total inputted, even if each unique address had mulitple entries.
- Burning is sending Tokens to a special wallet that is only able to accept tokens up to the 15% of minting pool during open seasons or this wallet will act as a wait list, where the users can send back thier defi tokens and as the pool seasons releases 15% of the minting pool around minting process, the next set of arrived transactions would be paid back, so participants could pre-send for burn-&-mix then later automatically by the contract receive their burn-back native tokens.
- - Burned tokens are mixed into the pool season so which acconts/transactions get paid in native tokens, the defi tokens received by them are used so less defi tokens needs to be minted. The difference is, sometimes during hyped inflations, the minting pool would mint less than expected, potentially off-setting the over minting from previous pool season mintings.
- - The unusual burn method can be gamified for participants to earn more on return of the native tokens, causing an extended loss of minting power. This is okay beacuse it will naturally drag the token value down closer to the native minting cost the longer it happens, in which this would stop the abuse because they would no longer earn more from burnbacks and not off set the minting power and return the token-nomics back on track.
- Because partipants are paying less then the tokens could be worth, this gives the defi 2.0 protocol of pool seasons with cool down to be worth more and could later be adjusted. The cool down timer could be adjusted in conjection to the pool season time, so if the pool season time is reduced the cool down time is increased, with 108hrs being the minimum time length for a pool season + cool down. This means that the total alloted time can be increased and could one day be an internal protocol used to auto adjust the three timers (pool season, cool down, total-time) as an automated difficulty adjustment system. This could be used to prevent malicious participants, malicious burnbacks, & oveerseeding entries.
- Pool seasons will hopefully be modulated where each pool season oversees each pool season and the contract oversees the pools. This would be a great hacking defense and is still in the works for what option will be possible. The minium pool season director can be a simple millasecond timer based on when the contract begins. So, if the contract starts at a specific block, time & date, that info can be represented as millaseconds. Every pool season start would be recorded by the block number and millasecond timer. Each pool season can be predetermined by approximately 259200000 millaseconds. Same goes for cool down timer and total alloted timers can all be represented as ~129600000 millaseconds & ~388800000 of millaseconds.
- Leftover or remaining native tokens (if any) are pushed to the ultra pool to be released in congruent sections (just like the rebase pools) but at 1% of pool holdings per pool season.
- - Ultra Pool rebase is sent to all pool season participants but each unique address is considered 1 new participant.
