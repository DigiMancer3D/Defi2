# Defi 2.0 Token names

The idea is to have a Defi 2.0 token on every major network (like Tron, Ethereum, EOS, & Sky), major chains (like BTC, LTC, & DOGE) & perhaps even it's own chain in the far future. 

## The new protocol is "Defi 2.0" [de-fī to͞o-point-ō]

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So what will the coins be called?

I want to keep the discussion easy and think of reasons why a name may be better on the current Tron chain. Here's the different propsed names for the tokens, to insert yours edit this page and insert yours as a new entry under the others with explinations at the bottom.

- rePool
- Reaper
- Tefi
- Mediveal Names (i.e.: guard, sword, chainmail, towers, etc etc etc)
- UBC (United Base Crypto)
- CBC (Community Based Crypto)
- Crayons

&nbsp; Explanations:
----

rePool - Because there's Pool Seasons (investing periods), the Minting Pool, reBase Pool, Ultra Pool, Dev Pool & Burn Pool.

Reaper - from the phrase, "The quicker One enters, the more they can 'reap'," this explains a gamified section of the token-nomics.

Tefi - Tron Decentralized Financial. Each chain would be represented by the first letter so like, Eefi, EOefi, Sefi, Befi, Lefi, etc.

Mediveal Names - Literally mediveal titles and names, like Castle, Tower, Guard, Kingsmen, Queensmen, etc. Would make wallets seem like a battlefield.

UBC - United Base Crypto. This concept idea is good enough to get other crypto alts to follow becuse much of the actions being performed are based on chain data.

CBC - Community Based Crypto. This is a community based growing intereset pools for later return which in turn helps deflate the forced inflation from the buying model.

Crayons - Different colors per chain, to represent the chain it originated from, would be a great idea if bridges get made later on like Tron and Ethereum is interchangable for most ERC20/TRX20 tokens so it is possible to have Crayon Swap sites where people would trade per color. The marketing writes itself some.
