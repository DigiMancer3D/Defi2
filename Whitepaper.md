# Defi 2.0: The Defi Standardization Protocol</br><sup><sub><sup>Designed by 3Douglas</sup></sub></sup>
</br></br>

## Introduction:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Decentralized Finance has not had too much long term success So with a standardization protocol we hope to create the new standard in all blockchain Defi tokens. The protocol being leveraged is a chain-data based system so trust is no longer needed for people to build on top of the concept which also allows for more chains to take advantage of the <i>Defi</i> concept easier than ever before. Defi 2.0 [D-Fy Two-Point-Oh] is based mostly on time mechanisms and offers leveraging contact forking to allow for possible modulation keeping each contract individually separated from the previous. This helps fight against hacking while pushing a greater gamification system to keep the project(s) moving without a <i><u>Rug-Pull</u> Scencerio</i>.
</br>
</br>
## Abstract:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By gamifying the token-entry, minting, distribution, burning, and controlling contract systems seen in <i><u>Defi 1.0</u></i> we can create a sustainable system and a sub-chain within the main chain for a type of <i>contract chain</i>.
</br>
</br>
## Gamification:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Defi is in essence <i><b>Gamified Investing</b></i> but with unusual controlling contracts that surround the current Defi tokens, Defi 2.0 (aka <i>Defi2</i>) hopes to change the controlling factor by adding in more gamification into the investing process which are as follows:
<li><b>Token Entry</b></li>
<li><b>Funding Pools</b></li>
<li><b>Pools</b></li>
<li><b>Minting</b></li>
<li><b>Fund Locking</b></li>
<li><b>Inflation/Deflation</b></li>
<li><b>Exiting</b></li>
<li><b>Mixing</b></li>
<li><b>Exchange Reliance</b></li>
<li><b>Pool Seasons</b></li>
<li><b>Contract Controller</b></li>
</br>
</br>

## Details:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gamifying the investing system can potentially help coin prices and build more stable coins with better tokenomics. Because every aspect of the tokenomics is gamified we will go over each step in the Defi2 process while explaining the gamification of each step.
</br>
### Token Entry:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The token entry is where each participant gets to place a bid for tokens. To enter the Defi2 ecosystem, native chain tokens need to be sent to the contract wallet while a pool season is open. Some chains or Defi 2.0 protocols may have built in swap contracts which allows non-native tokens to be auto-traded into the native chain tokens for entry, if a non-native token cannot be traded/swapped it may be burned or not used at all. Each participant must submit at least the minimum to mint the Defi2 tokens or for chains without Defi2 tokens, there is a minimum to entry based on the average transaction fee of that chain, which is the average fee + 75%. If the chain has native tokens, the minimum to entry is the minting cost + 75%.
</br>
### Funding Pools:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Funding Pools is a part of the gamification of the participant's entry gamification. To fund the minting, rebase, dev & burn pools each participant will have to pay 25% of the pool size except the very first participant of each pool season. The very first participant has to pay 25% of what they submit for the additional pools. To clarify, the first participant submits at least the minimum to entry + 25% to be able to get a safe-submission and be granted the ability to receive Defi2 distribution & rebase distribution. Every participant after the first successful participant has to pay their minimum to enter with their bid + 25% of the pool to get a successful entry. </br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This gamifies the pools and entry simultaneously because if you are the first participant to enter every pool season, you could enter the same amount every time and the amount to be received would be basically the same amount in comparison to any other participants. To clarify, each new participant has to pay more than the previous for their tokens. Since participants are paying the minimum (minting cost + 75%) with their bid, which could be more than the minimum entry cost, as well as 25% of the current pool size participants will want to be as close to the first participant as possible to simply save money. This also causes the possible coin price to increase with each new participant entry.
</br>
### Pools:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The pooling of funds in Defi2 is crucial to ensure everyone whom participates gets a cut of each token distribution they are supposed to gain. Defi2 has 6 pools, which are as follows:
<ol> <i>Pool Seasons</i> - The time frames of entry before minting/distribution of tokens.</ol>
<ol> <i>Minting Pool</i> - The pool used for minting Defi2 tokens.</ol>
<ol> <i>ReBase Pool</i> - The ReBase or dividend pool, used to redistribute tokens to cause predictable deflation.</ol>
<ol> <i>Dev Pool</i> - The Dev & Team Payback pool to pay whom worked on the building of Defi2.</ol>
<ol> <i>Burn-&-Mix Pool</i> - The pool used for Burn-&-Mixing the Defi2 tokens.</ol>
<ol> <i>Ultra Pool</i> - The roll-over pool of unused native tokens of the pool seasons.</ol>

### Minting:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Minting is normally a set price per minting processes or an x-amount native token per minting token. Because participants are paying the minting cost + additional instead of paying the coin price + additionals, we can keep a very stable minting process for longevity. The entry gamification allows for any pool season with just one participant to be able to mint that pool season.
</br>
### Fund Locking:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Normally with Defi the Defi tokens are locked up to help keep the economics of that token stable during the start of the Defi token's lifespan. A charge is set for users whom can't wait to use their tokens. Defi2 locks up a portion of the minting tokens instead and uses these tokens for ReBasing or distributing the dividends.
</br>
### Inflation/Deflation:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Traditional Defi relies on forced inflation to help increase price at the start of the token's lifespan. Defi2 has gone another route by gamifying the forced inflation and deflation to help <q><i>Peg</i></q> the Defi2 tokens to a non-dedicated price point. This means that within the Defi2 protocol, some of the gamification causes forced price inflation (entry + pool funding) while others causes forced deflation (reversed token locking).
</br>
### Exiting:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Exiting a Defi in traditional methods means paying extra to unlock your funds and selling off your Defi tokens. Defi2 gamifies exiting with the Burn-&-Mix process which basically allows any Defi2 token holder to submit their tokens to the Burn-&-Mix address during a Pool season. The Burn-&-Mix will only use what's received based on a percentage of the minting pool size to ensure there's always enough tokens to be minted. This means that even without exchanges, participants can exit to the native chain tokens. </br>Participants are paying not based on the defi token's price but the cost factor to mint, rebase and extras so after a handful of seasons the cost to buy during a pool season should be cheaper then exchanging. This will incentice people to burn tokens at the price of the token for native tokens (which are relased during/before minting and can only equal 15% of the minting pool at any time during an open pool season. This gamifies the burning process as well and allowing previous participants to re-participate in later pool seasons. Theroetically a participant could participate in every pool season except the 2cd season if they only burned defi tokens recieved to re-paricipate in later seasons.
</br>
### Mixing:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Defi2 doesn't really burn and only mixes what's sent in to be burned for the mixing. This gamifies the inflation and deflation a bit more. Potentially if enough Defi2 tokens exist on a chain, the participants can assist with the price pegging by sending in for Burn-&-Mix instead of dumping the token on exchanges. This means that if the Defi2 tokens are popular enough with enough tokens already minted, participants won't need to dump and the number of actual tokens being minted can be reduced per pool. Causing over time possible price stabilization without being pegged to any specific price.</br>The unusual burn method can be gamified for participants to earn more on return of the native tokens, causing an extended loss of minting power. This is okay beacuse it will naturally drag the token value down closer to the native minting cost the longer it happens, in which this would stop the abuse because they would no longer earn more from burnbacks and not off set the minting power and return the token-nomics back on track.
</br>
### Exchange Reliance:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the past coins & tokens rely on exchanges to exit and enter for many participants. Defi2 doesn't want to remove exchanges but reduce the need for them. Gamifying the exchange system is through the Burn-&-Mix procedure as well as the Peer2Peer design of the cryptocurrency chain.
</br>
### Pool Seasons:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Defi normally has a very quick shot that lasts an average of 1.75 days before destruction or breakdown of that token's economic structure. Defi2 has enough gamification and limited participation windows to help longevity. Because the time a participant can enter is locked around having an open pool season, this helps with forced deflation. Each pool season has a cool down before the next pool season can begin, preventing overlapping seasons and each new pool season is technically controlled by the previous season or the time controller contract. The time controller contract is for some chains that need a controlling contract to ensure pools are waiting the cool down. The time of an open pool season can be adjusted as well as the cool down time to help as a difficulty measure for either longer cool downs or longer seasons. The only requirement is either the seasons + cool down should equal to 4.5 days or the cool down time should be no-less than half the pool season or the pool season should be no-less than half the cool down time.</br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pool season participants are not equal, so in other words, if a wallet address participated in the previous pool season but not the next, they will not receive anything from the next pool season. Also participants may enter multiple times ensuring they have to pay all the same charges each time but with a newer growing amount for rebasing.
</br>
### Contract Controller:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Defi has two basic contract setups, controller and minter. Defi2 doesn't always need a controlling contract for some chains. If a chain has the need for a contract controller, the timing contract is that while chains that don't need a controller, the previous & next contract is the controllers. When a chain needs a controller, it's fairly simple but when the contracts are modules with no controllers, the previous contract controls the Ultra Pool and the next or current pool controls the activation of previous contract Rebasing. This can cause a trickling effect since Rebasing is done 4% of the pool per rebase giving each pool season 25 rebases per after that season has ended. 
</br>
</br>
## Pool Breakdown:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Pools are not equal and although much of the pools have been explained, let's look directly at the pools and what they get in percentages based on the final minting pool size.</br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The minting pool is the first collect all pool for each pool season, which gets broken down before and after minting.
</br>
### Before Minting:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before Minting the minting pool is examined and 25% of it is used for Dev Pool & the Burn-&-Mix Pool. These two pools split the initial 25% of the submitted native tokens by half. The Dev pool (10% of the 25% of the minting pool) pays the devs while the burn-&-mix pool (15% of the 25% of the minting pool) pays back used Defi2 tokens to their submitters. The Burn-&-Mix payments are sent to the addresses the Defi2 tokens were received by. The Burn-&-Mix pool is the received Defi2 tokens for BaM [Burn-&-Mix].
</br>
### After Minting:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After Minting the minting pool only has the minted tokens and remaining native tokens from the BaM offset. So the Defi2 tokens are divided in two, one section gets 75% of defi2 tokens while the other 25% of the Defi2 tokens gets locked for rebasing. The larger section is used to distribute to the participants of this pool season. The offset native tokens are pushed to the Ultra pool.
</br>
### Ultra Pool:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Ultra Pool is the only pool that pays to all participants of all pool seasons. So if a single wallet address entered every pool season that address is considered 1 participant. Gamifying is still usable here, because a participant could enter multiple times into the same pool season or each pool season just by using new wallet addresses, this gives them a higher chance of receiving more from the Ultra pool payouts when they come. Ultra Pool payouts only occur after a certain threshold has been made, this threshold may differ from chain to chain but only pays 1% of the total ultra pool per ultra pool distribution.
</br>
</br>
## Conclusion:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gamified investing may be the future of investing. Waves of funds can be moved per few days and participants can fight to be the first in for the next minting process. Because Defi2 runs mostly with on-chain data, any chain can take advantage of the protocol and either mint sub-tokens on chain or hold and redistribute native coins, either way native coins are distributed in one way or another. This isn't just gamified entry, this is entirely gamifying the investing setup for a decentralized community fund building that can also help the price points of the tokens/coins. Welcome to the new way of investing and helping the community build funds up as a team instead as a ponzi scheme.
