# Non-Dev Team Member Readme

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is the area for non-dev team members to be able to have in input for subjects like names, art, designs, and other non-technical assistance.

This is not a common thing in github but is going to help all of us bring our thoughts together with the devs and non-devs alike. 

You can simply edit this page and add in your commment or question at the bottom of this document.

Just place "##" at the front of your comment with a space between ## and your line of text.

### do not comment above the line that is below this text.

## 3D: I would like to welcome all the community members comming in. The interactinguserpage is the basic website, the other pages and folders are the acutal contracts and files used in building these tokens/protocols. Keep in mind your comments will be found within the tokens data for it's in this git, so keep your words mindful and lets collab and see what we come up with!
